## What it can do???
* Tap a infix and it will give you postfix and prefix.
  * Step by step, let you know how it compute that.
* Only use ( , ) , + , - , * , / , %.
* If there is any error, I make a simple handle.

## (O_O)
* If you want, you can change the stack class to vector.
  * I think vector is more convenience. I implement myself just because that is my homework.
* My other program [LargeNumberComputer](https://github.com/Zero871015/LargeNumberComputer) is used infix to postfix too. But there still are some different.
